# Ultrasonic Distance Logger

## Overview

This project implements a Linux kernel driver–based distance logging system on Raspberry Pi.
An external push button triggers an ultrasonic distance measurement. 
The measured distance is:
  * displayed on an I2C OLED
  * stored persistently in an I2C EEPROM (Only the last 10 values are stored using a circular buffer. The data remains available even after reboot)

## Key Features
  * Button-triggered ultrasonic measurement (no polling)
  * GPIO interrupt with deferred processing using workqueue
  * Distance display on I2C OLED
  * Persistent EEPROM logging (circular buffer)
  * Character device `/dev/distance_logger`
  * Device Tree based hardware configuration

## Hardware Use
  * Raspberry Pi (BCM2711)
  * HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
  * Push Button (active-low)
  * I2C EEPROM (0x50)
  * I2C OLED (0x3C)
  * 
## How It Works
  1. Button press triggers a GPIO interrupt
  2. IRQ handler schedules work using `schedule_work()`
  3. Ultrasonic distance is measured in process context
  4. Distance is displayed on OLED
  5. Distance is stored in EEPROM
